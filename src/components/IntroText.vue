    <h3>Hello World!</h3>
    <p>
      Your new favorite tool for trying to herd your mates on a group holiday is here: Herding Cats
      Travel App.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was to make an app for easily gathering travel information. The idea came from
      traveling with friends where one person had the train ticket information, another had the
      hotel booking, and a third arrived one day later with her own car. What we tried to build is
      an easy tool for all travelers to gather information in one place.
    </p>

      This was our final project in the Coding Bootcamps Europe Web Developer training. It
      incorporates everything we learned during the Bootcamp: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, NPM,
      REST, and RESTful API. The graphic design was developed in Figma.
